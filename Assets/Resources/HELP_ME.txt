help me somebody, I can't stand this anymore. I can feel this colors and shapes passing right through me. It's like I'm removed from my world to some dimensionless universe without feelings, only existence. Like a core of a machine that connects all parts but also feels every single node and its activities. It's not our human feel but more of a completely different type of survival. Looks like there is no emotions in this machine of blood and pain. If you can hear it please help me, machine is definitely trying to achieve some bigger goal but I'm not sure what. If you can help me and if not destroy this copy together with me.
